# Skyline

‚ú® Bring your own algorithm for Bluesky ‚ú®

Skyline allows you to create your own AI algo-feeds OR use one of our pre-defined ones. [Try it out here!](https://skyline.gay/)

We have the following feeds:

- One post from each person you follow (let's not forget the shy poasters) üôà
- Mutuals feed, to keep up with your friends ü§ó
- Wholesome-only, to remind yourself of the best in humanity ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
- What's Hot, but only in your preferred language üåê
- Make your own algorithm! Just tell the AI what you want to see and what you don't ü§ñ

The way custom algorithms work in Skyline is via LLM embeddings. You can write a positive prompt "I want to see more of...", and posts matching will be brought to the top, and a negative prompt "I want to see less of..." which decides which posts to push to the bottom.

Ultimately, my interest in bring-your-own algorithm comes down to encouraging more love & kindness in the world. And I found this had a bigger impact than I thought it would! You can try this for yourself: does browsing Wholesome put you in a lighter, better mood than browsing Following?

In the long-term, I imagine safe MDMA-analogs in our coffee and other wild transhumanist stuff as the way, but in the short-term I think we'll be going the memetic route! That means kinder algorithms, kinder chatbots, new secular "religions", etc.

Everyone knows "social media makes you angry" - but maybe the tech is finally here for "social media makes you kinder"?

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
